### 1. **Introduction to JavaScript**
   **Required Information:**
   - JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language. It is used primarily for adding interactivity to web pages.
   - It can be embedded in HTML using `<script>` tags.
   
   **Example:**
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>JavaScript Example</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Welcome to JavaScript</h1>
       <script>
           console.log("Hello, World!");
       </script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```
   
   **Homework Questions:**
   1. Write a simple HTML page that outputs "JavaScript is Fun!" to the console.
   2. Add a JavaScript function to the page that alerts "Welcome to JavaScript!" when the page loads.
   3. Write a JavaScript code that changes the text of the `<h1>` element on the page.

### 2. **Variables and Data Types**
   **Required Information:**
   - JavaScript has three main ways to declare variables: `var`, `let`, and `const`.
   - Data types in JavaScript include:
     - Primitive types: String, Number, Boolean, null, undefined, Symbol
     - Non-primitive type: Object
   
   **Example:**
   ```javascript
   let name = "John";
   const age = 30;
   var isEmployed = true;
   
   console.log(name, age, isEmployed);
   ```

   **Homework Questions:**
   1. Declare a variable `myAge` and assign your age as a number, then print it.
   2. Create an object with `firstName`, `lastName`, and `age` as properties, and print the object.
   3. Change the value of a `let` variable and print the result.

---

### 3. **Operators**
   **Required Information:**
   - Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
   - Comparison operators: `==`, `===`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
   - Logical operators: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT)
   
   **Example:**
   ```javascript
   let x = 5;
   let y = 3;
   console.log(x + y); // Addition
   console.log(x > y);  // Comparison
   console.log(x == 5 && y == 3);  // Logical AND
   ```

   **Homework Questions:**
   1. Write a program that checks if a number is divisible by 5.
   2. Use the comparison operator to check if a given number is equal to 100.
   3. Write a program that checks if a person is eligible to vote (age >= 18).

---

### 4. **Control Structures (Conditionals)**
   **Required Information:**
   - `if`, `else if`, and `else` are used to execute different blocks of code based on conditions.
   - The ternary operator (`condition ? true : false`) is shorthand for simple `if-else` statements.

   **Example:**
   ```javascript
   let age = 20;
   if (age >= 18) {
       console.log("You are an adult");
   } else {
       console.log("You are a minor");
   }

   // Ternary Example
   let status = age >= 18 ? "Adult" : "Minor";
   console.log(status);
   ```

   **Homework Questions:**
   1. Write an `if` statement that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
   2. Create a program that checks if a given year is a leap year.
   3. Use a ternary operator to check if a person is a teenager (age between 13 and 19).

---

### 5. **Loops**
   **Required Information:**
   - Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times.
   - The common types are `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.

   **Example:**
   ```javascript
   // For Loop
   for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
       console.log(i);
   }

   // While Loop
   let j = 0;
   while (j < 5) {
       console.log(j);
       j++;
   }
   ```

   **Homework Questions:**
   1. Write a program using a `for` loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 10.
   2. Use a `while` loop to find the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100.
   3. Write a program that prints all even numbers between 1 and 20 using a `for` loop.

---

### 6. **Functions**
   **Required Information:**
   - Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform specific tasks.
   - Functions can be declared and called in different ways (Function Declaration, Function Expression, Arrow Functions).
   
   **Example:**
   ```javascript
   // Function Declaration
   function greet(name) {
       return `Hello, ${name}`;
   }
   
   // Arrow Function
   const square = (x) => x * x;
   
   console.log(greet("Alice"));
   console.log(square(4));
   ```

   **Homework Questions:**
   1. Write a function `multiply` that returns the product of two numbers.
   2. Create a function `isEven` that returns `true` if a number is even, and `false` if it's odd.
   3. Write an arrow function that calculates the area of a circle (using the formula π * r²).

---

### 7. **Objects**
   **Required Information:**
   - Objects are collections of key-value pairs.
   - You can access object properties using dot notation or bracket notation.
   
   **Example:**
   ```javascript
   const person = {
       name: "Alice",
       age: 30,
       greet: function() {
           return `Hello, my name is ${this.name}`;
       }
   };
   
   console.log(person.name);
   console.log(person.greet());
   ```

   **Homework Questions:**
   1. Create an object called `book` with properties `title`, `author`, and `year`.
   2. Write a method within an object that calculates the age of a person based on their birth year.
   3. Update the object to include a `changeName` method that changes the `name` property.

---

### 8. **Arrays**
   **Required Information:**
   - Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.
   - Common array methods include `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, `unshift()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.
   
   **Example:**
   ```javascript
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   numbers.push(6); // Adds an element at the end
   numbers.pop();   // Removes the last element
   
   console.log(numbers);
   
   // Map Example
   const squared = numbers.map(num => num * num);
   console.log(squared);
   ```

   **Homework Questions:**
   1. Write a program that removes the first element of an array.
   2. Create an array of 5 numbers, use `map` to multiply each number by 2, and print the result.
   3. Write a program that filters out all even numbers from an array.

### 9. **ES6 Features**
   **Required Information:**
   - Template literals allow you to embed expressions inside strings using backticks.
   - Destructuring allows you to extract values from arrays or objects into variables.
   - The spread (`...`) and rest (`...`) operators simplify copying and passing arguments.
   
   **Example:**
   ```javascript
   // Template Literals
   const name = "Bob";
   const message = `Hello, ${name}`;
   console.log(message);

   // Destructuring
   const person = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe" };
   const { firstName, lastName } = person;
   console.log(firstName, lastName);

   // Spread Operator
   const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
   const arr2 = [...arr1, 4, 5];
   console.log(arr2);
   ```

   **Homework Questions:**
   1. Use a template literal to create a greeting message using your name.
   2. Use destructuring to extract the first and last names from a `person` object and log them.
   3. Use the spread operator to merge two arrays and print the result.

### 10. **Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises and Async/Await)**
   **Required Information:**
   - Promises represent a value that may be available now, or in the future, or never.
   - `async` and `await` simplify handling asynchronous code, making it look synchronous.

   **Example:**
   ```javascript
   const fetchData = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
       let success = true;
       if (success) {
           resolve("Data fetched successfully!");
       } else {
           reject("Error fetching data");
       }
   });
   
   fetchData.then(response => {
       console.log(response);
   }).catch(error => {
       console.log(error);
   });

   // Async/Await Example
   async function getData() {
       try {
           let response = await fetchData;
           console.log(response);
       } catch (error) {
           console.log(error);
       }
   }

   getData();
   ```

   **Homework Questions:**
   1. Create a `Promise` that resolves after 2 seconds with a success message.
   2. Write an `async` function that fetches data from a public API and logs it to the console.
   3. Modify the previous example to handle errors properly using `catch` and `try/catch`.

---

### 11. **Error Handling (Try/Catch)**
   **Required Information:**
   - `try`, `catch`, and `finally` are used to handle errors in JavaScript.

   **Example:**
   ```javascript
   try {
       let result = riskyFunction();
   } catch (error) {
       console.log("Error:", error);
   } finally {
       console.log("This will run no matter what");
   }
   ```

   **Homework Questions:**
   1. Write a program that catches an error when dividing by zero and logs the error message.
   2. Use a `try/catch` block to catch errors when trying to access a property of an undefined object.
   3. Create a program that throws an error if a user inputs an invalid email address.

---

### 12. **Classes and Objects (ES6)**
   **Required Information:**
   - Classes are blueprints for creating objects in JavaScript.
   - They support constructors, methods, and inheritance.

   **Example:**
   ```javascript
   class Person {
       constructor(name, age) {
           this.name = name;
           this.age = age;
       }

       greet() {
           return `Hello, my name is ${this.name}`;
       }
   }

   const john = new Person("John", 30);
   console.log(john.greet());
   ```

   **Homework Questions:**
   1. Create a `Car` class with properties `make`, `model`, and `year`, and a method `start`.
   2. Create a `Book` class with `title`, `author`, and `pages` properties, and a method `read` that returns a message.
   3. Write a `Student` class that extends `Person` and adds a `grade` property.

---

### 13. **DOM Manipulation**
   **Required Information:**
   - The DOM (Document Object Model) represents the structure of an HTML document.
   - JavaScript can interact with and manipulate HTML elements via the DOM.

   **Example:**
   ```html
   <button id="myButton">Click Me!</button>
   <script>
       document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
           alert("Button clicked!");
       });
   </script>
   ```

   **Homework Questions:**
   1. Create a button that changes the text of a `<p>` element when clicked.
   2. Write a program that changes the background color of the page when a button is clicked.
   3. Add an input field and create a program that logs the entered value when the user presses a button.

---

### 14. **Modules**
   **Required Information:**
   - JavaScript modules allow you to split your code into reusable files.
   - You can import and export functionality using `import` and `export`.

   **Example:**
   ```javascript
   // In math.js
   export function add(a, b) {
       return a + b;
   }

   // In app.js
   import { add } from './math.js';
   console.log(add(2, 3));
   ```

   **Homework Questions:**
   1. Create a module that exports a `subtract` function and import it into another file.
   2. Write a `multiply` function in a module and import it to use in your main file.
   3. Create a module with several mathematical functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and import them into your main program.

---

### 15. **Advanced Topics (Closure, Scope, Hoisting)**
   **Required Information:**
   - **Scope** determines the visibility of variables (Global vs Local).
   - **Hoisting** is the behavior of JavaScript where variables and functions are moved to the top of their scope during the compile phase.
   - **Closure** occurs when a function retains access to its lexical scope even after the outer function has finished executing.

   **Example:**
   ```javascript
   function outer() {
       let outerVar = "I'm from the outer scope";
       function inner() {
           console.log(outerVar);
       }
       inner();
   }
   outer();
   ```

   **Homework Questions:**
   1. Write a program that demonstrates variable hoisting with `var` and `let`.
   2. Create a closure where an inner function has access to an outer function’s variable.
   3. Demonstrate the use of lexical scope with a function that calculates a value using both an outer and inner variable.
